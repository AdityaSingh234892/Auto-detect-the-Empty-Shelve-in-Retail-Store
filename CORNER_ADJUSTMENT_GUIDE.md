# Enhanced Shelf Monitoring System - Corner Point Adjustment Feature

## New Features Added

### ðŸ”§ 4-Point Corner Adjustment System
Your shelf monitoring system now includes precise corner point adjustment functionality:

#### How It Works:
1. **Initial Selection**: Click and drag to create a rectangle around your shelf area
2. **Name Assignment**: Enter a descriptive name for the shelf area
3. **Corner Adjustment Dialog**: Choose whether to adjust corners for perfect shape
4. **Precise Positioning**: Click to position each of the 4 corners individually
5. **Perfect Shelf Shape**: Create custom polygon shapes that match your actual shelves

#### Visual Feedback:
- **Green Polygons**: During selection mode
- **Orange Polygons**: During corner adjustment mode  
- **Red Polygons**: During monitoring when shelf is empty
- **Corner Points**: Visible circles at each corner
- **Active Corner**: Highlighted in yellow during adjustment

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. Load your video file
2. Click "Select Multiple Areas"
3. Draw rectangle around shelf area
4. Enter shelf name
5. Choose "Yes" for corner adjustment
6. Click to position corner 1/4, then 2/4, then 3/4, then 4/4
7. System automatically completes adjustment
8. Continue with more areas or click "Done"
9. Start monitoring

### ðŸš¨ Improved Monitoring & Alert System
The monitoring system has been enhanced to work with polygon shapes:

#### Advanced Detection:
- **Polygon-based Analysis**: Uses precise 4-corner shapes instead of simple rectangles
- **Mask-based Processing**: Creates accurate region masks for better detection
- **Multi-method Analysis**: Combines edge detection, pixel variance, and histogram analysis
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides accuracy percentage for each detection

#### Visual Monitoring:
- **Real-time Polygon Overlays**: Shows exact monitored areas
- **Pulsing Alerts**: Empty shelves pulse with red borders
- **Status Text**: Shows "EMPTY" or "OK" with confidence levels
- **Corner Markers**: Visible corner points during monitoring

#### On-Screen Notifications:
- **Alert Messages**: 3-5 second on-screen alerts
- **Modern UI**: Card-based design with attractive styling
- **Color-coded Messages**: Success (green), warnings (orange), alerts (red)
- **Auto-dismiss**: Messages automatically disappear after timeout

## Usage Instructions

### For Corner Adjustment:
```
1. Select shelf area with rectangle
2. Enter shelf name
3. When prompted: "Do you want to adjust corners?"
   - Click "Yes" for precise adjustment
   - Click "No" to keep rectangle shape
4. If adjusting: Click each corner position (1â†’2â†’3â†’4)
5. System shows: "Perfect! Shelf shape adjusted"
```

### For Monitoring:
```
1. Complete area selection (with or without corner adjustment)
2. Click "Done Selecting"
3. Click "Start Monitoring"
4. Watch real-time polygon-based detection
5. Receive instant alerts for empty shelves
```

## Technical Improvements

### Data Structure Changes:
- **Old Format**: `(x, y, width, height, name)`
- **New Format**: `([(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4)], name)`

### Enhanced Detection:
- **Polygon Masking**: Creates precise region masks
- **Bounding Box Extraction**: Efficiently extracts regions for analysis
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Maintains smooth UI during monitoring

### Visual Enhancements:
- **OpenCV Polylines**: Draws accurate polygon shapes
- **Corner Visualization**: Shows clickable corner points
- **Dynamic Highlighting**: Active corners highlighted during adjustment
- **Pulsing Effects**: Alert animations for empty shelves

## Troubleshooting

### If Monitoring Doesn't Work:
1. Ensure you've selected at least one shelf area
2. Check that video is loaded properly
3. Verify shelf regions are visible on screen
4. Try adjusting sensitivity slider (0-100)
5. Check console output for error messages

### If Corner Adjustment Fails:
1. Make sure you click within the video area
2. Wait for each corner confirmation message
3. Click corners in order: top-left â†’ top-right â†’ bottom-right â†’ bottom-left
4. If stuck, restart selection process

### Performance Tips:
1. Use smaller video resolution for better performance
2. Select only necessary shelf areas
3. Adjust sensitivity for your specific environment
4. Close other applications for better performance

## Files Modified:
- `modern_gui.py`: Enhanced with corner adjustment and polygon support
- `simple_detector.py`: Optimized detection algorithms
- `run_app.bat`: Easy launcher script

## Next Steps:
1. Test with your specific shelf videos
2. Adjust sensitivity settings as needed
3. Train the system with your product types
4. Monitor and refine detection accuracy

Enjoy your enhanced shelf monitoring system with precise corner adjustment! ðŸŽ¯
