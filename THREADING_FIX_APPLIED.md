🔧 THREADING ASSERTION ERROR FIX APPLIED
================================================

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
The error "Assertion fctx->async_lock failed at libavcodec/pthread_frame.c:173" 
is caused by threading conflicts in FFmpeg's video decoder when multiple threads 
try to access the same video stream simultaneously.

## 🛠️ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Environment Variables (Most Important)
```python
os.environ['OPENCV_FFMPEG_CAPTURE_OPTIONS'] = 'threads;1'  # Force single thread
os.environ['OPENCV_VIDEOIO_PRIORITY_FFMPEG'] = '0'        # Lower FFmpeg priority  
os.environ['OPENCV_VIDEOIO_DEBUG'] = '0'                  # Disable debug output
```

### 2. Enhanced Video Capture Initialization
- **Single-threaded decoding**: Disabled frame threading that causes assertion errors
- **Buffer size reduction**: Set to 1 to prevent buffer conflicts
- **Frame rate limiting**: Set to 25 FPS to reduce threading pressure
- **Multiple backend fallbacks**: Default → FFmpeg → DirectShow

### 3. Thread-Safe Frame Reading
- **Error handling**: Catches and recovers from threading assertion errors
- **Consecutive failure tracking**: Prevents infinite loops on repeated failures
- **Recovery mechanisms**: Resets video position on read failures
- **Reduced refresh rate**: 20 FPS for display, proper timing for monitoring

### 4. Backend-Specific Optimizations
- **FFmpeg**: Single-threaded with reduced buffer
- **DirectShow**: Windows-native, inherently single-threaded
- **Default**: Fallback with conservative settings

## 🎯 TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Threading Issue Explanation:
The assertion error occurs when:
1. FFmpeg tries to use multiple threads for video decoding
2. OpenCV creates additional threads for frame processing
3. Multiple threads access the same decoder context simultaneously
4. pthread mutex locking fails due to race conditions

### Our Solution:
1. **Force single-threaded decoding** via environment variables
2. **Serialize frame access** with error handling
3. **Reduce threading pressure** with slower refresh rates
4. **Use Windows-native backends** when possible (DirectShow)

## 📋 VERIFICATION STEPS

1. **Environment Variables**: Set before any OpenCV operations
2. **Video Capture**: Uses enhanced initialization with threading fixes
3. **Frame Reading**: Protected with try-catch and recovery logic
4. **Monitoring Loop**: Thread-safe with failure recovery

## 🚀 EXPECTED RESULTS

❌ **Before Fix**: "Assertion fctx->async_lock failed at libavcodec/pthread_frame.c:173"
✅ **After Fix**: Clean video loading and playback without assertion errors

## 💡 ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

If you still encounter issues:
1. **Restart the application completely** to apply environment variables
2. **Try different video formats**: MP4 is more compatible than AVI
3. **Use lower resolution videos** if possible
4. **Ensure only one video application** is running at a time

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

✅ Environment variables set
✅ Enhanced video capture initialization
✅ Thread-safe frame reading implemented  
✅ Error recovery mechanisms added
✅ Backend fallback chain implemented
✅ Monitoring loop made thread-safe

**The threading assertion error should now be completely resolved!**
